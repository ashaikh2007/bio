            <h3>The theory of evolution is a well supported, science based theory on the origin of life. There are many things that support this theory, such as
                <li>Fossils - Show that previous versions of an organism existed, and current day versions evolved from that ancestor</li>
                <li>Biogeography - Show that similar species could be distrubuted over different locations due to different lines of descent</li>
                <li>Anatomy - Similar organisms have similar anatomy and bone structures (homologus structures), indicating a common ancestor. Very different organisms that live in similar areas with similar anatomy (analogus structures) also prove evolution because it shows that they have the same adaptations</li>
                <li>Similar embryonic development - Growth of an organism follows its evolutionary history, and organisms with similar embyonic development indicate a common ancestor between them</li>
                <li>DNA eveidence - Similarity in DNA indicates that all life evolved from a common ancestor</li>

            <h2>The theory of acquired characteristics</h2>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row;justify-content: space-between;">
                <h3>This theory was thought to have explained evolution, but was proven <u>wrong</u> later. It was created by Lamarck, and consisted of the following:
                    <li>Organisms acquired traits through using their bodies in new ways (eg. a girrafe would develop a longer neck by stretching its neck out more)</li>
                    <li>Traits are passed to offspring as process of adaption</li>
                    <li>Disuse leads to atrophy and disappearance, use leads to development (law of use and disuse)</li>
                </h3>

            </div>
            <br>
            <h3>This theory was partially correct. Traits <i>are</i> passed down to offspring. However, there was a lot that was corrected with Darwins theory of evolution</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Darwins Theory of Evolution</h2>
            <h3>
                <li>New traits are acquired through <u>random</u> genetic mutations</li>
                <li>Organisms produce more offpspring than can survive, so only the best adapted end up surviving</li>
                <li>Natural selection is the process where organisms better adapted to their environment survive, while the others die</li>
                <li>Genetic mutations can be passed to offspring</li>
                <li>All life shares common ancestors, and all organism are modified verions of their ancestors</li>
            </h3>
            <br>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Process of evolution through mutation</h2>
            <h3>The first step in a species evolving is introducting a new gene variation through developing a mutation. After that, there are many factors that determine if the trait is passed down</h3>
            <h2>Selective Pressures</h2>
            <h3>Selective pressures are environmental conditions that determine if a trait will be helpful (eg developing webbed feet is a helpful trait if you live in water, but not on land). <u>Natural selection</u> is the process where traits that helpful against selective pressures are passed down, since the organisms have an advantage, while the organisms without helpful traits or traits that are detremental again selective pressures die off.There are biotic pressures, such as
                <li>Predators - The types of predators will determine what mutations help survive against it</li>
                <li>Competition for food - Traits that give organism advantage over other organisms when it comes to getting food</li>
                <br>
                There are also abiotic pressures, such as 
                <li>Light - The amount of light can determine if a trait is helpful (eg a mutation where the organism doesn't require as much sunlight is considered helpful)</li>
                <li>Wind - The amount of wind can determine if a trait is helpful (eg a trait where the organism is more protected from the wind is considered helpful)</li>
                <li>Soil - The composition of soil can determine if a mutation is helpful or not</li>
                <li>Water - The amount of available water can determine if a trait is helpful or not</li>
                <br>
                In general, traits that help an organism against selective pressures are passsed down, while organisms without the helpful trait typically die off due to competition from organisms with the helpful trait. This process is called natural selection.
            </h3>

            <h2>Reproductive fitness</h2>
            <h3>An organisms reproductive fitness determines how well it can produce viable, healthly offspring. Organisms with higher reproductive fitness will typically pass their traits on more effectivly and contribute more to the overall population, while organisms with low reproductive fitness will eventually produce no offspring and have minimal contributions to a population</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Artifical selection</h2>
            <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: space-between;">
                <h3>Artifical selection is a type of selective pressure. It is the selective breeding of organisms. This is done to either keep or remove cecrtain traits, regardless of their ability to help an organism survive. This is commonly seen with dogs and fruits</h3>

            <h2>Adaptation vs variation</h2>
            <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row;justify-content: space-between;">
                <h3>Another thing that affects if a mutation is passed down is if it's a variation or adaptation. A variation is a mutation with no purpose (eg different eye color). Since it doesn't offer any benifits, if most likely won't evolve into a trait the entire population posseses, since natural selection doesn't take place. However, that the trait won't necessarily completly die out either, since it doens't give a disadvantage. An adaptation is a mutation that is helpful to the organism. There are 
                    <li>Structural Adaptations - Affect physical body stucture of organism</li>
                    <li>Behavioral Adaptations - Affect behaviors of an organism (eg migration)</li>
                    <br>
                    These can be passed down within an entire population through natural selection
                </h3>
                <div style="font-family: Mont;margin-left: 50px;">

                </div>
            </div>
            <h3 style="text-align: center;">These factors can determine if a trait is passed down within a population, and if a species can start the process of evolution. However, there are also other mechanisms of starting evolution within a species</h3>
            <h2>Genetic Drift</h2>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
                <h3>Genetic drift refers to the change of the overall genetic makeup of a population due to chance. Usually, it consits of shrinking a population substantially and recreating the population with only a fraction of the original members. The new resulting population will have different overall genetic makeup because the entire population is based on a few surviving members of the original population. There are two types of genetic drift
                    <li>Bottleneck effect - When a catastrophic event takes out the majority of a population. The new resulting population is based on the few that survived the event, and may be different. For example, if the population previously had mostly blue eyes (high allele frequency of blue eyes), but the survivors all had brown eyes, the new population would have mostly brown eyes (high allele frequency of brown eyes) </li>
                    <li>Founder effect - When a portion of a population seperates from the rest of the population. The resulting new population may have a different allele frequency(frequency of certain traits)</li>

            <h2>Non random mating</h2>
            <h3>Non random mating is when mating is pre-determined. It prevents other organisms from with particular characteristics from mating, which results in their traits being erased from the population's gene pool (overall genetic information of a population). Non random mating can cause a population to evolve (change in gene pool over generations) to disclude certain traits from the gene pool</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Mutation</h2>
            <h3>Random mutations are the <u>ultimate</u> source of variation. Helpful mutations can be subjected to natural selection, and eventually an entire population can evolve to have those traits</h3>
            <br>
            <h2>Gene flow</h2>
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between;">
                <h3>Gene flow is the sharing of genes between populations. <br>
                For example, a population of birds migrating south mates with the southern population. Over generations of this behavior, the two different populations will begin to share more DNA and be more alike.
                </h3>

            </div>
            <br>
            <h2>Natural selection</h2>
            <h3>Natural selection is the major driver behind change. It determines if a trait helps or hinders an organisms performance. Helpful traits are passed down due to the fact that organisms with the trait have hiigher rates of survival. Over generations and the process of evolution, the trait become a part of the entire population.</h3>
